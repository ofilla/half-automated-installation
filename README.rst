Half-Automated Installation
===========================

This project is inspired by
*FAI* - `Fully Automatic Installation <https://fai-project.org/>`_.

While FAI targets installations on multiple similar machines,
HAI targets similar installations on different machines.
I.e., the base OS must be installed *before* using HAI.
